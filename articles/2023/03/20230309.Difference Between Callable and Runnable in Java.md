# Introduction

Both `Runnable` and `Callable` are `interface` for multiple-thread in Java. Let's compare them with code.

The main differences:

|              | Runnable Interface               | Callable Interface                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Package      | java.lang.Runnable since JDK 1.0 | java.util.concurrent.Callable Since JDK 1.5 |
| Method       | `public abstract void run();`    | `V call() throws Exception;`                |
| Exception    | Can't Throw an exception;        | Can throw an exception;                     |
| Return Value | Can't return any result;         | Can returun the result you want;            |



# The definition code

`Runnable`:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    /**
     * When an object implementing interface <code>Runnable</code> is used
     * to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object's
     * <code>run</code> method to be called in that separately executing
     * thread.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of the method <code>run</code> is that it may
     * take any action whatsoever.
     *
     * @see     java.lang.Thread#run()
     */
    public abstract void run();
}
```



`Callable`:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V> {
    /**
     * Computes a result, or throws an exception if unable to do so.
     *
     * @return computed result
     * @throws Exception if unable to compute a result
     */
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```



# How to use

## Runnable

Implement the interface with overriding the `run()` method:

```java
class PkslowRunnable implements Runnable {
    private final String name;

    PkslowRunnable(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(name + " is running");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println(name + " is completed");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```



We can use `ExecutorService` to submit the Runnable task:

```java
private static void runnable() {
  ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r1"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r2"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r3"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r4"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r5"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r6"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r7"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r8"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r9"));
  executorService.submit(new PkslowRunnable("pkslow.r10"));

  awaitTerminationAfterShutdown(executorService);
}
```



Output:

```bash
pkslow.r4 is running
pkslow.r2 is running
pkslow.r3 is running
pkslow.r1 is running
pkslow.r2 is completed
pkslow.r4 is completed
pkslow.r1 is completed
pkslow.r3 is completed
pkslow.r5 is running
pkslow.r6 is running
pkslow.r7 is running
pkslow.r8 is running
pkslow.r5 is completed
pkslow.r7 is completed
pkslow.r6 is completed
pkslow.r8 is completed
pkslow.r10 is running
pkslow.r9 is running
pkslow.r10 is completed
pkslow.r9 is completed
```





## Callable

Implement the `Callable` interface with overriding the `call()` method:

```java
class PkslowCallable implements Callable<Integer> {
    private final String name;

    PkslowCallable(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }


    @Override
    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        System.out.println(name + " is running");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println(name + " is completed");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return (new Random().nextInt()) % 100;
    }
}
```

We will return a random `int` as a result.



Similarly, we can use `ExecutorService` to submit the `Callable` task:

```java
private static void callable() {
  ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
  List<Future<Integer>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c1")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c2")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c3")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c4")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c5")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c6")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c7")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c8")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c9")));
  futures.add(executorService.submit(new PkslowCallable("pkslow.c10")));

  futures.forEach(ft -> {
    try {
      System.out.println("Result from Future: " + ft.get());
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  });

  awaitTerminationAfterShutdown(executorService);
}
```

With the `Future.get()`, we can fetch the result.



Output:

```bash
pkslow.c1 is running
pkslow.c3 is running
pkslow.c2 is running
pkslow.c4 is running
pkslow.c2 is completed
pkslow.c1 is completed
pkslow.c3 is completed
pkslow.c4 is completed
pkslow.c5 is running
pkslow.c7 is running
pkslow.c6 is running
pkslow.c8 is running
Result from Future: 62
Result from Future: 3
Result from Future: -1
Result from Future: 38
pkslow.c7 is completed
pkslow.c6 is completed
pkslow.c8 is completed
pkslow.c5 is completed
pkslow.c10 is running
pkslow.c9 is running
Result from Future: 19
Result from Future: -42
Result from Future: 73
Result from Future: 84
pkslow.c10 is completed
pkslow.c9 is completed
Result from Future: -32
Result from Future: -48
```
