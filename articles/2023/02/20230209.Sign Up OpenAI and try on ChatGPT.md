# Sign Up

It's not easy to create the account on `OpenAI` due to the restriction. You need the VPN to access the network and also need a number in other country. However, you can use the [sms-activate](https://sms-activate.org/) to receive the activate code.

When your acount is ready, you can login [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to play.

# Playground

The OpenAI playground is a good product,

We can try the OpenAI with the `Playground`, select the `Q&A` Mode and it will come up a template. Let's ask some questions:

You can select different mode and model:

What's more, the OpenAI can generate the code to all the API, so we can automate the way to use OpenAI:

The ChatGPT also support multiple languages, I tried with Chinese, the answers are the same:

I hope OpenAI will provide the API for `ChatGPT`, that would be much funny.
